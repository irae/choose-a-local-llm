No model measurement has run. The run tests Arete Q3_K_M and S5-nano
Q8_0 on arrietty with official llama.cpp stable v0.9.0.

## Machine setup

The official mise runtime is v0.9.0, build b12110, commit
`cd959bae99ff4bed22bef2604f45241c09bbb8c8`. It reports CUDA0 and the
required reasoning-budget, Jinja and router flags. The idle official
router stopped before the run. The Linux start sample was 787 MiB VRAM
used, 25,997 MiB available RAM, and 0 MiB swap used. GitHub auth and
pi 1.5.0 pass. The corpus server returned HTTP 200.

The S5-nano GGUF contains one `nextn` head. MTP remains disabled.
No direct cache-quality evidence was found for either fine-tune.

Record KV comparisons and smoke verdicts first. Smokes are unscored
and stay in this run. Add the measured depth curves, full EvalPlus
results and simulator(mendel) artifacts as their blocks close.
