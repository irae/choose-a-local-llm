# Run 12 — state

Draft kit, not started as a scored run. Pre-block prep landed
2026-09-07: wired 24000 ceilings for Qwen3.6 GGUF q8_0 and f16,
found while debugging a `local-llm-eval-tools` compaction issue on
this machine. See `results.md`, "Pre-block prep" section, for the
numbers, the two open questions (a false-positive compaction stop at
depth 32818, and swap growth under wired 25000 with no recovery gap
between sweeps), and links to the full tool-side evidence on
`local-llm-eval-tools`'s `creep-ab-verdict` and
`creep-configurable-thresholds` branches.

Handing over: the coordinator sets `AGENT.md`'s wired-limit line
(24000 or 25000) after reading the linked evidence, then the run
proper starts.
